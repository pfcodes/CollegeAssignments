Discussion Log
Assignment: Project 6
Name: Phil Fevry

Time taken: About a week @ around 5 hours a day each (~35 hours)

What I learned:
- Increased understanding of why its important to split tasks up into various methods for readability and ease of modification 
- I employed valuable practice on designing and laying out classes.
- Nothing special is needed to really create files. PrintWriter outputs to a file just like it outputs to screen. 
- (Offtopic) started using a third-party text-editor with the java compiler instead of BlueJ and I realized the production gains of using a text editor over an IDE for simple projects.

Difficulties Faced:
-Figuring out how to design the main algorithm
-- The first commit had an infinite loop some but not all the times when it first ran

Resources Used:
Java API

==================
(NEW)
Version 1 changes:
- Refactored and reorganized a lot of code to be less redundent and easier to read
- Made comments more clear and easier to understand
- Sorted the cards before each shiftCards() cycle
- Added JavaDocs

Time taken: 4 hours

What I learned: 
- Increased appreciation for making debug/testing tools
- More about Git and importance of version control

Difficulties I faced:
- Figuring out how to fix the infinite loop condition in the last commit

How I fixed it: 
- Noticed a pattern with every output where an infinite loop occured

Output in Terminal =
[ 1   2   3   4   5   5   8   8   9 ] - 5 & 8
[ 1   2   2   3   5   7   8   8   9 ] - 2 & 8
[ 1   2   3   4   5   5   8   8   9 ] - 5 & 8
[ 1   2   3   3   5   6   8   8   9 ] - 3 & 8
[ 1   2   3   4   4   6   8   8   9 ] - 4 & 8

- The number 8 was always involved.
- I figured it must have been an off by one error because 8 is one less than 9
- I tweaked the numbers in shiftCards() and most of the methods that dealt with unique numbers
